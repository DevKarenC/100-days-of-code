# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!

## 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 0: Jan 29, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Finish the Etch-A-Sketch project

**Thoughts:** Before I started the project, I read the guidelines provided by the Odin Project and created a list of Minimum Viable Product features and optional features that the app would still function without, but would definitely be nice to have. This list helped me focus on what I should prioritize before diving into additional features.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] How to apply styling to certain elements using [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
- [x] How to generate random RGB color
- [x] How to add styling to native HTML color picker

**Link to work:** [Etch-A-Sketch App](https://devkarenc.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

## Day 1: Jan 30, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Work on the Odin Project - Fundamentals Part 5
- [x] Work on JavaScript30 Day 4

**Thoughts**: It was nice to refresh my memory on objects and higher-order array methods. I appreciate that there are free and accessible resources to make me better at JavaScript.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] `console.table()` function to display my data as a table!
- [x] How objects are ordered in JavaScript (integer properties are ordered in ascending order vs. non-integer properties are ordered in creation order)

**Link to work**: [JavaScript30 Repo with notes](https://github.com/DevKarenC/JavaScript30-with-notes)

## Day 2: Jan 31, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Work on the Odin Project - Fundamentals Part 5
- [x] Work on JavaScript30 Day 7
- [x] Start the Calculator project

**Thoughts**: I continued to work on the JavaScript exercises on objects and array methods available on the Odin Project and the second part to the higher order array methods offered by JavaScript30 course.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Understanding how other people solved the Caesar Cipher problem and how to improve my solution
- [x] How to use `.some()`, `.every()`, `.find()`, `.findIndex()`

## Day 3: Feb 1, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Work on the Calculator project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 1 (Drum Kit)

**Thoughts**: I wanted to try out a new CSS layout in addition to the Flexbox, and thought CSS Grid Layout was the perfect alternative for my Calculator project. It worked great for my purpose and I can't wait to start using it for my other projects! As for the logic portion of the calculator, I noticed that there were many edge cases to implement the decimal point functionality.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)

## Day 4: Feb 2, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Review notes
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 2 (CSS Clock)
- [x] Object and Object Constructors
- [x] Continue working on the Calculator

**Thoughts**: I am slowly making progress on the Calculator, although there are some corner cases that I should consider. For example, the calculator should display an output whether the user clicks on the equal (=) sign or any other operators such as +, -, /, or \*. Also the number cannot start with a 0 (or have 2 consecutive zero's), but the user should be able to perform mathematical operations with 0. I spent some time trying to figure out the logic, and decided to take a break by learning about object and object constructors. Object-oriented programming is such an important concept, and I look forward to the day when I can comfortably utilize it in my own project.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Object Constructors and relevant concepts including `new`, `prototype`, and `this`

## Day 5: Feb 3, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Object and Object Constructors
- [x] Recipe Library Project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 3 (CSS Variables)

**Thoughts**: There were so many concepts in Objects that were new to me including how the `new` keyword behind the scenes, what the `prototype` object is, and how the `this` keyword fits into the system. Since I wanted to practice the new knowledge (and I think the best way is to work on a project that incorporates them!), I got started on the Library Project. I tweaked the project a little bit, and decided to make a Recipe Library where a user can save their favorite recipes.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] How to create a modal box with CSS and JavaScript
- [x] [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

## Day 6: Feb 4, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Practice recursion problems on codewars

**Thoughts**: I had the opportunity to participate in the short mock interview session with an Engineering Mentor, and was given a recursion problem to solve. It is definitely more nervous to code with someone else under the interview setting, and I know that the only way to get better is to keep practicing until I get comfortable thinking out loud! Just like any other skills in programming, knowing how to communicate your thoughts to your interview and fellow engineers is a skill you can improve with practice.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Using default parameters in recursive functions
- [x] Thinking out loud when practicing algorithm problems (just do it)

## Day 7: Feb 5, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Finalize the Calculator Project

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the online Calculator Project inspired by the Odin Project. The calculator is able to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, x, / with both positive and negative and floating point numbers), and it is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It was a great learning opportunity as I had to refactor my code to handle edge cases and making sure that the basic functions of a calculation are performed correctly. For instance, a number cannot (1) have more than one decimal point or (2) lead with a zero (trailing zero's are fine). Also, if a number is negative, the negative sign should disappear with the first digit as the user clicks on the backspace button (i.e. a negative sign cannot hang alone). While the project was challenging, it is rewarding to see the finished product without giving up! I cannot wait to work on other projects that will advance my programming skills.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Considering edge cases and handling them with care
- [x] DOM Manipulation

## Day 8: Feb 6, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Work on the Recipe Library Project
- [x] JavaScript30-with-notes Repo

**Thoughts**: I am making a good progress on the recipe library project inspired by the Odin Project, and I hope to finalize it tomorrow! Also I have been following Wes Bos' JavaScript30 exercises and made a repo to record, share, and review what I have learned from them. Just like this 100 days of code repo, it will be updated on a regular basis.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30 with Notes](https://github.com/DevKarenC/JavaScript30-with-notes)

## Day 9: Feb 7, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Finalize the Recipe Library Project and update Readme

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the Recipe Library project and also update the Readme (which feels like another project on its own) with a short description, list of features, and project demos. Although I first learned about data attributes from JavaScript30 Day 1 exercise, I haven't gotten a chance to put my knowledge in practice until this project. It's a very useful and cool feature to use, and I can see myself using it for my future projects as well.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Using a third-party library ([Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/))
- [x] Putting data-attributes in practice

**Link to work:** [Recipe Library](https://github.com/DevKarenC/recipe-library)

## Day 10: Feb 8, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Learn about Factory Functions (The Odin Project lesson)

**Thoughts**: I spent some time to learn about the factory functions in JavaScript. With factory functions, we can simply set up and return a new object. To deepen my understanding, I also learned about how execution contexts, scope, and closure are all related and are very important concepts in JavaScript. Seeing how factory functions can make our code easier to read, refactor, and test inspired me to organize my code using factory functions and write more modular code.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Factory functions
- [x] Execution Context (global and function)
- [x] Scope
- [x] Closure

## Day 11: Feb 9, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Learn about the JS Module Pattern
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 5 (Flex Panels Image Gallery)
- [x] Start the Tic-tac-toe Project using modules

**Thoughts**: Learning about the JavaScript module pattern was great, since they are a practical way to make my code organized, reusable, and isolated. The best way to practice something new is to actually use it, so I started working on the Tic-tac-toe project where I thought about how to break down different pieces before I started writing code. Since I am putting more thought into how I structure my code, it is taking me longer to craft each line of code. It's all part of the learning process! On another note, the Odin Project (TOP) is great, and I think one way to fully utilize it is to make sure that I am learning from other resources. After realizing that some articles and videos suggested by TOP are from 2015 (which is the year when ES6 came out, but I'm sure it took people some time to adapt), I looked for resources that incorporated ES6 and more modern JavaScript and learned from those as well. Wes Bos' JavaScript30 is great as always, and spending ~30 minutes to independently try and achieve the desired outcomes help me learn better rather than just watching the video and copying his code (unless I am totally lost - then I learn from the expert 😅)

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] JS Module Pattern
- [x] How to organize HTML/CSS code
- [x] flex property for the flexbox, translateY property, cubic-bezier... all the cool CSS knowledge!
- [x] JS classList.toggle() method instead of using if-else
- [x] listening to the transitionend event

## Day 12: Feb 10, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Continue working on the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 8 (HTML5 Canvas)

**Thoughts**: I continued working on the tic-tac-toe project and making some progress on how to write factory functions. I still need more practice on determining which variables and methods to keep private or public, but it's fun to think about how they would impact the overall picture. Sometimes I find myself thinking too hard about the structure and not writing enough code, and I tell myself that I can always start getting some features done first and refactor my code later since I don't want to get bogged down with the fact that I should be writing the _perfect_ code from the get-go. We all have to start somewhere.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] HTML5 Canvas, 2D context and different properties and methods associated with the context

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30 with Notes - Day 8](https://github.com/DevKarenC/JavaScript30-with-notes/blob/main/08%20-%20Fun%20with%20HTML5%20Canvas/index-START.html)

## Day 13: Feb 11, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue working on the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] Review factory functions & function declarations and expressions
- [x] Learn how to use Chrome/Firefox/VS debuggers
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 9 (Cool Dev Tools Tricks)

**Thoughts**: For the tic-tac-toe project, I was able to add JavaScript logic to display O or X symbol depending on which player's turn it is and determine the winner. One issue I encountered was that the gameboard in the DOM was showing a different symbol from what was in the actual gameboard array. Learning how to use a debugger was really a game changer since I did not use a single line of `console.log()` to fix the issue! All I had to do was add several break points and add variables in the Watch tab of VS Code. I hope to finalize the project within the next 2 days.

## Day 14: Feb 12, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue working on the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 10 (Checkbox Challenge)

**Thoughts**: Majority of today was spent working on the tic-tac-toe project and the JavaScript30's Checkbox challenge. Although I have yet to learn the TDD (Test Driven Development), I think it would have been beneficial for the tic-tac-toe project because as I was testing my code, I found myself clicking on the board 100+ times to see if there are any holes in the logic. Perhaps when I work on the Connect Four project in the future, I can implement the TDD. As for the checkbox challenge, I am glad that I was able to write the code independently first before diving into the lesson. The tough part was performing the necessary actions _while_ listening to the shift keydown event simultaneously. After researching, I learned that you can do so by declaring a boolean variable that will toggle its boolean value as it listens to both the `keydown` and `keyup` event. I still watched how Wes Bos tackled the challenge, and it was a good learning experience.

## Day 15: Feb 13, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Finalize the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 11 (Custom HTML Video Player)

**Thoughts**: There are just so many things I learned while working on the tic-tac-toe project (which will be discussed in the project Readme) but the big ones are utilizing comments to improve code readability and managing the scope creep. I found it helpful to leave comments in code to myself (and future fellow engineers 😎) to demonstrate the rationale on why I wrote certain functions. I am aware that there are different opinions on whether comments improve code readability or not, and I can see where both sides are coming from. For now, I like to leave comments on my work since there is still much for me to learn, and one way I learn is by documenting the work. As for managing the scope creep, I found myself coming up with new features that wasn't included in my original list of features. While they were good features to have for the user experience, it was also important for me to finish the project and distribute the resources (time and energy) on other programming topics. 

**Link to work:** [Tic-tac-toe Project](https://github.com/DevKarenC/tic-tac-toe)

## Day 16: Feb 14, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Refactor the code base for the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] Review Prototypes, prototype chain, this keyword
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 12 (Key Sequence Detection)

**Thoughts**: I was able to get feedback on how to improve my code for the tic-tac-toe project from a senior engineer. Some of the new things I learned is that it can be beneficial to create constants for values such as empty string, O symbol string, and X symbol string since that would help me manage the values with one source of truth. If I were to change the symbols to some other values such as a space or a diamond, I can simply change the value for the constants. The naming convention for constants is using all uppercase characters. In addition, I was able to remove unnecessary variables that don't add value to the code. For instance, the `haveWinner` boolean variable inside the `determineWinner()` function was unnecessary since I could have simply returned `true` or `false`. 

## Day 17: Feb 15, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Update the Readme for the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 13 (Slide in on Scroll)
- [x] ES6 Classes (The Odin Project)

**Thoughts**: I can say that the tic-tac-toe project is "officially" done now that I updated the Readme for it! It's a good way to showcase what I have done and also acts as a personal reminder for my accomplishments. I am also almost halfway done with the Wes Bos' JavaScript30 courses, and I appreciate learning something new everyday. The Slide in on Scroll lesson was focused on understanding the different heights (innerHeight, offsetTop...) related to the window or the HTML element and involved more math than other topics. The debouncing and throttling are also something I can see myself using in the future. This [site](http://demo.nimius.net/debounce_throttle/) helped me understand the difference between the two. 

## Day 18: Feb 16, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Refactor the Recipe Library project using ES6 Classes
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 14 (References vs. Copy)
- [x] The History of JavaScript - ES6 Modules (The Odin Project)

**Thoughts**: I refactored the code for the Recipe Library to use ES6 classes feature instead of using plain constructors. I feel more confident in using classes in my future projects and look forward to using the `extends` keyword as well to practice inheritance. Today's JavaScript30 lesson on pass by reference vs. pass by copy refreshed my memory on those topics. The lesson was released in 2017, so it was interesting to learn that some features mentioned as "not official" in JS actually became an official feature in JS - such as using a spread operator with an object literal to make a shallow copy of it. Also learning of the [tc39 repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) where one can see the different features being proposed to be official is very cool. I will continue to learn from the ES6 Modules lesson in the Odin Project.


## Day 19: Feb 17, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue learning about the History of JavaScript, npm, yarn, webpack, and ES6 Modules (The Odin Project)
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 15 (localStorage and Event Delegation)

**Thoughts**: Learning about the History of Javascript was interesting and now I have a better understanding of how ES6 modules came about and why they are beneficial. JavaScript has come a long way from plain HTML and JS to using a package manager, a module bundler, a transpiler and a task runner to automate various features. I have heard about webpack before and how it's a "module bundler", but did not really know what that meant. After watching videos about it and coding along the tutorial in the documentation, it's making more sense. As for JavaScript30, it was a good lesson to learn about localStorage and event delegation. I can see myself using those feature in the future for my projects.

## Day 20: Feb 18, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Learn about the Object-oriented Programming Principles (The Odin Project)
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 15 Bonus Challenges 
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 25 (Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling, and Once)
- [x] Start the Pet Photography Website project

**Thoughts**: I completed the challenge suggested by Wes Bos for JS30 Day 15, which was to add 3 different buttons (delete item, check all checkboxes, uncheck all checkboxes). What helped me with the challenges were being able to analyze the code from the lesson, tweak them to match my need, and to take a step back to rethink about the initial approach and come up with a better one. There was a lot to learn from Wes Bos' code and I like how he made a separate `populateList` function to handle the DOM manipulation. For today's JS30 lesson, I skipped to Day 25 because the topics (Event capture, propagation, bubbling...) seemed relevant to Event Delegation, which is what I learned yesterday. Without a doubt, I read multiple articles that discussed how bubbling allows event delegation to happen. The more I study JavaScript, the more topics I come across that I did not know existed. The "SOLID" OOP Principles and Pub-Sub Design Pattern are good examples of such topics. For my project (the Odin Project suggested making a Restaurant Page, but I decided to go with something different and will create a pet photography website instead 🐕🐈), I look forward to applying the Single Responsibility principle to improve my code.

## Day 21: Feb 19, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 16 CSS Text Shadow
- [x] Learn about CSS positions and units
- [x] Work on the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: I finished another day of JavaScript30 and as always, learning about one topic led me to research other relevant topics. In today's lesson, Wes Bos used the offsetX and offsetY properties but I was curious about other properties included in the event object, such as clientX, pageX, and screenX. It feels good to supplement the knowledge with the documentation, helpful YouTube videos and Stack Overflow posts. The Pet Photography website project is coming along pretty well - using modules to divide up the code makes it easier to follow and more clean to read.

## Day 22: Feb 20, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 17 Sort without Articles
- [x] Learn about regular expressions
- [x] Continue working on the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: Today's JavaScript30 lesson was short, but regardless it refreshed my mind on how to use the `sort()` method and how knowing regular expressions (commonly known as regex) can be useful. From the Coding Train's YouTube channel, I learned how regex breaks down a word to spot a generalized pattern (for example: the word "Rainbow" can be broken down into a capital R, followed by a lowercase a, lowercase i... all the way until a lowercase w.) There is a whole video series on regex and I look forward to engaging with the rest in the future. I'm continuing to work on the Pet Photography website project and simultaneously taking notes on what I would like to improve on or refactor. The tab switching works fine but there is always room to grow. Let's see how I can refactor once I'm done with the project.

## Day 23: Feb 21, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 18 (Tally String Times with Reduce)
- [x] Continue working on the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: Learning how to add the total durations of videos using the array reduce method was a good way to build on the foundations of JavaScript. Before diving into Wes Bos' solution, I solved the problem on my own using different methods such as .forEach(), .map(), .split(), and more. It felt great when I learned that I wrote a similar line of code as a pro but also created something different independently. Out of the three tabs in my project scope, I finished two tabs so I only have one more to go. I hope to finalize the pet photography website project tomorrow and look forward to receiving feedback to improve my code. 

## Day 24: Feb 22, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 19 (Webcam Fun)
- [x] Learn about promises, async/await
- [x] Finish the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: JavaScript has changed so much in the last 3 years ever since the JavaScript 30 series came out. Some of the features introduced in today's lesosn such as `Navigator.getUserMedia` and `localMediaStream` were deprecated and no longer recommended by the MDN. It was confusing at first because `Navigator.getUserMedia` was deprecated so MDN recommended `MediaDevices.getUserMedia`, but I ended up using `Navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` since `Navigator.mediaDevices` returns the `MediaDevices` object. Also looking through the MDN examples to see how the method is used helped a lot. In regards to setting up the project, Wes Bos introduces browser-sync but I think I could have used the Live Server VSCode extension to achieve the same outcome. I did learn that using `npm install` without any arguments installs dependencies outlined in `package.json`, which is pretty cool. Although I haven't played much with media streams such as webcam and canvas before, it was still a good lesson that extended to other important topics such as promise, .then(), .catch(). As for the Pet Photography website, I was able to finish writing code for the essential modules. I will take some time tomorrow to refactor, update Readme, and deploy the project github page since the project was built using webpack.

## Day 25: Feb 23, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 20 (Speech Recognition)
- [x] Learn about Webpack asset management
- [x] Refactor code, update readme, and deploy the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: I loved today's JS30 topic of Speech recognition since I always thought it would be cool to work with it! I primarily use Firefox for deveopment so when I first tried the feature in a Firefox browser, unfortunately it did not work due to the feature not being supported (in fact, multitude of other browsers did not support the Speech Recognition Web API according to the browser compatibility table in MDN docs). At the end of the lesson, I enjoyed thinking about the practical examples like "Siri/Alexa -  get the weather" as suggested by Wes Bos and I can't wait to build an application that uses speech recognition. One idea that comes to mind is a [Smart Home with Raspberry Pi](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/02/how-to-build-your-own-private-smart-home-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-mozillas-things-gateway/). As for the Pet Photography website, I refactored the code base to include a file for the constants such as phone number, email, address, and business hours so that it's easier to access or change them in the future. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to practice implementing the Single Responsibility principle and using webpack for module bundling. 

## Day 26: Feb 24, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 21 (Geolocation-based Speedometer and Compass)
- [x] Learn about Webpack output management and development
- [x] Learn about JSON
- [x] Review callbacks and learn about promises

**Thoughts**: I had a chance to briefly try out the iPhone simulator on xcode and it was great. It's a feature that I didn't know even existed. I can see that it will be useful when I learn how to use the React Native framework and test my application on the xcode simulator. Continuing with the Odin Project curriculum, I learned more about webpack plugins related to output management (ex. HTMLWebpackPlugin) and also Development. Source map is great since it tells you which file and line the error came from instead of just printing that the error came from `bundle.js`. I have previously used webpack's --watch mode to automatically compile my code, and I will try out the `webpack-dev-server` in the future.

## Day 27: Feb 25, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 22 (Follow along and highlight links)
- [x] Design wireframes for the Todo List Project
- [x] Set up the Todo List Project with webpack
- [x] Learn about Linting

**Thoughts**: As I go through the JavaScript30 lessons, not only do I learn from the lessons but also from other people's YouTube video comments. Today's lesson was related to hovering over the links and making the white highlight span appear on the hovered links. One of the comments wrote that this feature would be useful for the tooltip system, which would be cool to have in my future projects. For my next project, I plan to work on the Todo list as suggested by The Odin Project, and I designed some wireframes and set up the configuration files for eslint and webpack. I have been using eslint extension for VSCode, but not as a dev-dependency. It's awesome that I will be learning from a different style guide (I chose Airbnb), but I also acknowledge that it's important to stay flexible and open-minded since every team would follow a different style guide.


## Day 28: Feb 26, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 26 (Stripe Follow Along Navigation)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project
- [x] Learn about different CSS frameworks

**Thoughts**: I skipped to Day 26 of JavaScript30 to continue with where I left off in yesterday's lesson of following along the navigation links. I reviewed the "this" keyword and the arrow function scope as they were discussed during the lesson, and also learned that you can use `display: none` and `opacity: 0` in two different classes and toggle those properties to create the smooth transition effect. As I continued to work on the Todo List project, I decided to explore [different options for CSS libraries and frameworks](https://geekflare.com/best-css-frameworks/) and came across Bulma. I like the fact that its classes are very readable and it offers helpful documentation and video courses, so I will be using it throughout the project. Excited to use and learn something new!

## Day 29: Feb 27, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 6 (fetch type ahead)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: I went back to Day 6 of JavaScript30 since I wanted to learn about Fetch API, but I learned more regex than fetch in my opinion. Regex can be useful in many situations so I'm glad I got additional practice. For the Todo list project, I created two classes - one for TodoList and the other for TodoItem. I did not make one extend from another class, since I thought those two classes were pretty distinctive and did not require inheritance. Perhaps in the future I can refactor code, but that's the idea for now. In addition, I reviewed my project features to see how the user would add a todo item and noticed that the user can only add a todo item inside a todo list (i.e. folder of todo items). Therefore, I only exported the TodoList class with addTodo method, which creates a new instance of a TodoItem class. It takes me some time to plan it out, but it's fun thinking in terms of object oriented programming 👏🏻 

## Day 30: Feb 28, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 23 (Speech Synthesis)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: There is always a lot to learn in the JavaScript30 lessons, and I have a longer list of what I learned today. For example, it's a good idea to look through the YouTube comments to see if anyone else had the similar problem as me, or offered a solution. The project did not work for me in Firefox and I thought the feature wasn't supported in the Firefox browser. But the browser support table suggested otherwise, and I learned from a comment that I can call `.getVoices()` method on `window.speechSynthesis` and then call the `populateVoices()` method on page load. After following another programmer's advice, it worked on both Chrome and Firefox like magic! In addition, it's great to learn from how Wes Bos structures his code; he divides functionalities into multiple functions instead of putting everything into one big function. Also, I like how we can first test if the callback function is working properly by including a simple `console.log()` inside the function definition to see if we see the text in the console. As for the Todo List, I am slowly making progress by adding functionality to the "+ New List" button. 

## Day 31: Mar 1, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 24 (Sticky Nav)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: From today's JavaScript 30 lesson, I was able to fill in some gaps in my CSS knowledge. For instance, I did not realize that you can add a class to the overarching parent div (such as body) and use CSS combinators to conditionally refer to the descendant elements for the before and after CSS effects. Also, I learned the difference between the `width` and `max-width` properties in terms of resizing the screen, since the element can be responsive when used with `max-width`. For the Todo List project, I worked on getting the static version of the todo list done so that I have the visuals to refer to when converting it to the dynamic page. It's helpful when I can easily see how the page would look and to which elements I should add the event listeners. 

## Day 32: Mar 2, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 27 (Click and Drag)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: I came across the [MDN Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer) that offers a vast variety of articles and active learning practices to complete for different topics in web development. I had previously read some articles as they were suggested by the Odin Project, but didn't know MDN also offered such a roadmap for beginners striving to become a front-end web developer. I primarily used MDN for documentation purposes to confirm my knowledge regarding the built-in functions, but seeing that there are many interesting topics such as cross-browser testing and Accessibility guides, I can see myself visiting MDN more often for these resources.

## Day 33: Mar 3, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 28 (Video Speed Controller)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: I made a good progress on the Todo List project today, and I think part of the reason is that I tried not to get overwhelmed by the number of functionalities I need to add. It helped to break them down into smaller pieces and tackle them one at a time. For instance, I had to convert the static todo list page to render dynamically in response to the user's click events. I tried to break it down by thinking about "What should happen when the user first clicks on the todo list on the side nav bar? What should appear first? How would the data behind the scenes change?", then made small but frequent commits to the repository. I hope to finalize the project by the end of this week and leave time to refactor and improve the code base.

## Day 34: Mar 4, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 29 (Countdown Timer)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: After working on the timer as part of JavaScript30 exercise, I feel inspired to build my own version of the Timer as a Firefox or Chrome browser extension and publish it. Perhaps the timer could be my next project after I complete the Todo List. It would be cool and useful to create a timer that reminds the user to look away 20 feet for 20 seconds every 20 minutes, or get up and stretch for 5 minutes every hour (I spend a long time staring at the screen, so I know I'll use it for sure!). I found a helpful article by MDN related to [building your first extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension), so I'll take a look at it before I start the extension.

## Day 35: Mar 5, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 30 (Last day!) (Whack-A-Mole)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: I can't believe today was the last day of JavaScript30 and I have finished all 30 exercises! It's been a great journey and I learned so much about vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and various Web APIs (check out my repo [here](https://github.com/DevKarenC/JavaScript30-with-notes), where I recorded what I learned from the lessons). I am planning on compiling all the exercises into one website. I also noticed that some people added additional features and functionalities to the exercises, which I think is a good idea to continue practicing JavaScript and build up the foundations. 
Since I already went through the exercises once before, I can focus on expressing my creativity to add different customizations. Wes Bos also offers FlexBox/CSS Grid courses, and they look helpful so I'll get started on those tomorrow.

## Day 36: March 6, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Watch the What the Flexbox Tutorial 1 - 10 and take notes
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: Although I have used the Flexbox previously in my projects using the documentation, it was good to watch tutorials on them for review and there were some properties I have yet to use, such as `align-content` and `order`. They look useful so I hope to use them in the future. The Todo List project is taking a little longer than expected due to some road blocks in the way, but since I'm still learning, I rather take the time to learn than speeding through topics that I do not know yet.

## Day 37: March 7, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: I spent today adding the add/edit notes, delete todo, and set due date for todos features for the Todo List project. In addition, I am in the process of implementing localStorage for the project. I haven't worked much with localStorage before, and I encountered some issues where I was trying to access the methods defined within my TodoList class on the data saved in localStorage. I got an error saying that the class method was not a function, and after some research, I learned that it's a common problem experienced among others. Since localStorage should be used for persisting data (not functions) and the data is saved in a string, I looped through each string (after parsing) and made each one a new instance of the TodoList class again using the `new` keyword. It was frustrating at first, but it feels great to debug the issue step by step.

## Day 38: March 8, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Finalize the Todo List Project (finally! 🥳)

**Thoughts**: I was able to finalize the Todo List project today! I implemented the localStorage feature so that the user's todo list data persists even when the browser closes and opens again, and fixed some bugs related to the buttons with event listeners attached to them. I had to go back and review
how event listeners work with the documentation and YouTube vidoes, since the project had an issue where the todo buttons (toggle star, delete button, edit notes) did not function properly after the user clicks on a different todo list. At first I thought the issue was due to using the `addEventListener()` function inside another function, which is only ran once inside a module. However, after testing with some dummy code and reading [other resources](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39548324/how-long-do-window-event-listeners-persist), I learned that the event listeners remain attached to the target (element) unless the target is destroyed or you remove the event listener from the target. Since I was regenerating the DOM elements every time the user clicks a todo list (meaning the existing ones were destroyed and the new ones _without_ the event listeners are generated), I was able to fix the issue after attaching the event listeners again to the new elements. This bug took me a while to resolve, but I'm satisfied with how I successfully debugged the code and fixed the issue. I will be updating the project Readme and refactor the code in the upcoming days while continuing the Odin Project with Asynchronous JavaScript topics.

## Day 39: March 9, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Watch the What the Flexbox Tutorial 11 - 15 and take notes
- [x] Improve Day30 of JavaScript30 course

**Thoughts**: I thought of different ways to improve to Whack-A-Mole game from JavaScript30 lessons, and decided to go with one of them. The "issue" was that the user is able to earn more than 1 point when they click on the same mole multiple times consecutively when it appears from the hole. I wanted to change the game so that the user can only score 1 point per 1 mole apperance. Initially it seemed like an easy feature to add, but many of the solutions that I attempted did not work out as intended so I ended up spending more than I anticipated. At the end, I was able to solve it by creating a variable called `lastBonkedMole` and setting it to what was last bonked in the user's click event, and when the mole disappears, I set it back to undefined. Just like this fix, adding one new feature may seem easy (ex. implementing an all-time scoreboard), but there can be multiple sub-tasks to accomplish it. For the all-time scoreboard feature, I would need a localStorage to save the user's scores, prompt user to enter the name when the score is high enough, and think about how to display the scoreboard to the user. This makes it important to appropriately plan out what is needed to implement a feature or fix a bug. It was a good practice working with other people's code (Wes Bos in this case) since in the real world, I will be working with the code base that the team wrote and modify it based on the business's needs.

## Day 40: March 10, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Read chapters 1 (Async) and 2 (Callbacks) of You Don't Know JS (YDKJS)
- [x] Learn about promises, API (ex. fetch), and asynchronous JavaScript

**Thoughts**: I have heard great things about the book series You Don't Know JS (YDKJS), and since they were recommended by the Odin Project to learn about the asynchronous JavaScript, I read the first two chapters of the book. The chapters were dense so I definitely need to read them several times before I can fully comprehend everything discussed within. Our brains are used to the sequential way of thinking, so the nature of the callbacks where we often find ourselves jumping around the code base to understand is naturally difficult to process. However, we can use Promises, fetch API, and async/await keywords to reduce callback hell and handle asynchronous tasks more efficiently. I will put them into practice through the Weather App project.

## Day 41: March 11, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review Async/Await (JavaScript.info)
- [x] Work on the Weather App

**Thoughts**: To put the asynchronous JavaScript concepts into practice, I got started on the Weather App project. As with many projects, I encountered several errors related to the configuration files (dotenv and Babel (async/await keywords) in this case). For example, I kept getting an error message that said "Uncaught SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal" and it didn't tell me which file the error derived from, but only said "bundle.js". Not a helpful error message but that's the programming life. After dabbling with the code, I figured out that it was coming from my .env file due to my API_KEY value. After reading [more stackOverflow answers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55185601/webpack-process-env-undefined-using-defineplugin-and-dotenv/65264701#65264701), I learned that I shouldn't really be using `process.env` in the front-end and that webpack 5 doesn't provide access to `process`. As an alternative, I can place the API key in another .js file and add that .js file to the .gitignore file to prevent pushing it to github by accident. I won't be able to deploy it for the lack of API key, but I can still showcase my work via demo screenshots and gifs in the github repo's Readme file. I'm excited to continue the weather app tomorrow.

## Day 42: March 12, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Watch What the Flexbox tutorials 16-20 and take notes (finished the series)
- [x] Continue the Weather App project

**Thoughts**: I finished the Flexbox tutorial and I feel more confident in using Flexbox display and its properties that I haven't used much before, such as `flex-wrap`, `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`, and `order` to create a responsive website. Before, I was used to setting the flex-direction property to column and using justify-content/align-items to center when I wanted to vertically and horizontally center flex items. But I learned that you can also set the flex-wrap property to wrap so that the flex items wrap around accordingly based on the width of the flex container, achieving the similar effect as `flex-direction: column`. As for the weather app, I learned how to read the documentation and get the necessary information for the project. For instance, the default temperature unit was in Kelvin but you can set the unit to be metric or imperial to get the temperature in celsius or fahrenheit. The OpenWeather API also provided the appropriate weather icons to be used according to the weather such as rainy, sunny, or cloudy, so I didn't have to use icons from other sites. In addition, I noticed that my app designs can change from the initial layout so it helps me to work out the JavaScript logic first and then play with the styling later, which can change in the future.

## Day 43: March 13, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue working on the Weather App

**Thoughts**: For the Weather app, I was able to retrieve the data from the OpenWeather API and spent some time to make the data more human readable by adding appropriate units such as % for humidity and miles or meters for the wind speed. In terms of converting the temperature unit from fahrenheit to celsius and vice versa, although the API data was available in both units, I did not work to make another API call since it would be slower than calling a function that can convert the value and unit on the fly. In addition, I created an object for all the weather data, which will be populated when the API call is made, so that there is only one source of truth instead of getting the weather data from different sources such as the DOM text node. As I was writing the function to convert the units, I realized that I don't need to have 2 different functions (fahrenheit to celsius and celsius to fahrenheit) since the API call already provides data in the imperial format (specifid by me). I can just define a function to convert from imperial to metric and call that function as needed. When I need to convert from metric to imperial, I can just use the original data provided by the API. It was helpful to think out loud before writing code!

## Day 44: March 14, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue working on the Weather App

**Thoughts**: I implemented the error handling logic by using `.catch()` method to the `getWeather` function to catch status codes such as 400 when the input is empty or 404 when the input city doesn't exist. I learned that `fetch()` doesn't throw an error unless it's a network error and since 4xx error codes are not network errors, [I need to throw new errors and handle them ourselves](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38235715/fetch-reject-promise-and-catch-the-error-if-status-is-not-ok). I was also able to implement the Unsplash API to display a random image as a background image that corresponds with the input city name. It works great, and tomorrow I will work on adding a functionality so that when the input is empty or the city doesn't exist, the website doesn't make an Unsplash API call.

## Day 45: March 15, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue working on the weather app (almost done!)

**Thoughts**: While implementing a corresponding background image for the input city, I was experiencing an error similar to a common off-by-one error but I was able to fix it after realizing that I was not making the API call at the right place. In terms of layout, I used media queries to make sure the content fit in a smaller sized window. There was an issue where the vertical content would be cut off even upon scrolling, and the fix was to utilize `min-height` instead of regular `height` CSS property since min-height is responsive to the screen size changes. Finally, I did not like how the location would show an abbreviated country name such as US for United States, so I parsed the CSV file with country code and name by using [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/). I converted the result to a Hashmap for easier access to the country's full name based on the country code. It was important to keep in mind that [Papa parse is an asynchronous library](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27741388/papaparse-returns-undefined-when-reading-csv), so I had to use the `complete` callback function to display the data (country's full name). Otherwise, JavaScript would throw an error saying that the Hashmap (`countryCodes`) is undefined. I'm glad that I was able to accomplish the MVP features (display weather data and toggle unit) as well as the optional features (display matching background image, handle response errors, mobile-responsive, display full country name, display different weather icons accordingly) in order, instead of working on an optional feature first and experiencing burn out while the essential feature is not yet finished. I will be updating the Readme and other housekeeping tasks tomorrow to wrap up the Weather App project.

## Day 46: March 16, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Update Readme for Covid-19 project
- [x] Review CLI
- [x] Learn about Test-Driven Development and Reading Specs

**Thoughts**: For the COVID-19 Tracker project that I worked on before, I decided to update the Readme to make it easier for people to understand what the project is about, its features, and different technologies used (languages, API, libraries). Ever since the first Readme, I had improved in showcasing my work with demo screenshots and GIFs, instead of leaving it blank or just writing one or two lines without a detailed description. 

## Day 47: March 17, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue learning about Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Reading Specs
- [x] Finalize the [Weather App project](https://github.com/DevKarenC/weather-app)

**Thoughts**: There is a variety of new "quirks" of JavaScript that I came across today. For example, while learning how to write and read specs (unit tests) for the TDD, I learned that multiplying `undefined` and `undefined` returns a `NaN`, not a number. But `NaN` actually has a numeric data type (despite it being "not a number"!) [whose value cannot be represented with actual numbers](https://bitsofco.de/javascript-typeof/). When you run `typeof NaN`, it returns "number" as the data type. Also, if you execute a function that takes in parameters without actually supplying the arguments, [JavaScript would set those missing arguments as undefined](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1846679/what-happens-when-i-call-a-javascript-function-which-takes-parameters-without-s). It feels good to fill in the knowledge gap while learning about something seemingly irrelevant (ex. TDD and NaN quirks). In terms of TDD, I am focusing on Jasmine testing framework and learned about what the `describe`, `it`, `expect` functions and `toBe` matcher method do. I understand that test-driven development is important and can improve your code/project in many ways - I'm excited to start using them in my projects. For the [Weather App](https://github.com/DevKarenC/weather-app), I made sure to add screenshots and GIFs and the detailed list of features and learning outcomes to the Readme. Since I did not deploy the website (to protect the API key credentials), I felt that detailed Readme would help the potential user understand its capabilities and how to use it in their local machine.

## Day 48: March 18, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review prototypes
- [x] Review factory functions
- [x] Review the value of `this` in Callback functions

**Thoughts**: When it comes to the `this` keyword in JavaScript, I was used to the implicit binding of `this` and how you can look to the left of the dot to figure out the value of `this`. I realized I'm not too familiar with the value of `this` inside callback functions as I was watching a video to learn about factory functions (funny how one topic can lead to learning a different topic - so common in programming from my experience 😅). I came across two good articles: [How to Eyeball Your ‘This’ Context in Javascript](https://gist.github.com/zcaceres/2a4ac91f9f42ec0ef9cd0d18e4e71262) and [Mastering ‘this’ in JavaScript: Callbacks and bind(), apply(), call()](https://thenewstack.io/mastering-javascript-callbacks-bind-apply-call/). Essentially, the value of `this` inside a callback function can change depending on the higher-order function that invokes the callback function. It's important to inspect the function's **call site** to inspect `this`. I also noticed that many articles suggest using an arrow function syntax to solve the `this` problem, and my follow-up question then became "how exactly does the arrow function syntax work to solve `this`"? I felt like I needed to understand the arrow function's **scope**, so that would be my goal tomorrow to research into it.

## Day 49: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review loops, nested loops, looping through objects

**Thoughts**: Nested loops in JavaScript can be confusing and I found it helpful to print out lines such as ``console.log(`Outer loop i: ${i}`)`` and       ``console.log(`Inner loop j: ${j}`)`` to see how many times the outer and inner loops each run and observe the pattern. It might also be helpful to think of the outer loop as a _row_, and inner loop as a _column_ since for every row, there can be `n` number of columns, which is what happens with an inner loop. On a side note, whenever using higher-order functions (ex. map, reduce, filter...) with arrow function syntax with curly braces, I need to remember to actually return the element with a `return` keyword. Otherwise, nothing will be returned from the higher-order functions.

## Day 50: March 20, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Learn about bubble sort algorithm
- [x] Review data types in JavaScript

**Thoughts**: While working on the practice problems, I came across one that utilized Bubble Sort algorithm. I remember that Harvard University's CS50 course offered a [section on sorting algorithms](https://video.cs50.io/gR6nycuZKlM?screen=CRl1MoW0F-E) and one of them being bubble sort, I went back to watch a video and it was very helpful in understanding how the bubble sort algorithm works (ex. bigger number "bubbling" to the right end of the list, focusing on a pair of adjacent numbers at a time). While learning algorithms can be tough, I know that it's important for my career to learn them (as well as data structures). In terms of counting Github contributions, I learned from [this blog post](https://hisaac.net/2016/11/11/why-commits-to-forks-on-github-dont-count-toward-contributions.html) that making commits to a forked repository does not count towards the contribution because Github only intends the forked repo to be a _temporary_ place to store your work before merging into the upstream repo. I have been using forked repo to store my permanent work so I'll have to work on using my forked repos as Github intended.

## Day 51: March 21, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review data types, scope, ES6, and git
- [x] Checklist.design

**Thoughts**: I came across the [checklist.design](https://www.checklist.design/) while doing research on project checklist and designs. It looks like a great website to reference when I'm building my portfolio site or a capstone project. The website seems more targeted for UI/UX designers to assist with their design work, many checklists suggest good features to have in a website if a developer wants to showcase their development skills. For example, the checklist for the Login page includes "Login via Third Party" and "Link to reset password", which would be good concepts to practice. I'm excited to utilize the checklist.design website for my portfolio.

## Day 52: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review nested loops, constructor functions, prototypes (spaced learning!)

**Thoughts**: There are some topics that I like to review on a regular basis, and one of them is nested loops. I watched some YouTube videos on the topic by [The Coding Train's Nested Loops - Processing Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7frvcAHXps) and [Steve Griffith - JavaScript Nested Loops with Arrays and Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqgVLYpBWG8), both of which were great videos to refresh and confirm my knowledge on nested loops. In addition, constructor functions and prototypes (especially the prototype object and the dunder proto property) can be confusing if I don't review them periodically. I learned that the prototype property is an object with two properties to it: 1. constructor and 2. __proto__. Dunder proto (__proto__) really just **points** to the prototype object in which the instance has inherited. For example, running this expression `arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype` would evaluate to true since arr instance inherits from the Array object. Spaced repetition and practice are especially helpful in reviewing the concepts that I thought I understood before (but when I come back to review them, some topics tend to get mixed up in my head 🧐). Of course, the best way to retain knowledge is by using them in my code (whether it's for a project or pratice problem).  

## Day 53: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Practice constructor functions with stack data structure
- [x] Review Arrow functions and how they differ from regular function declarations
- [x] Review Execution Context, Scope, and Closure
- [x] Learn about Lexical Environment
- [x] Refactor the Weather App code

**Thoughts**: I had briefly learned about the stack data structure before so I recall some knowledge like the fact that stack manages data as Last In, First Out (LIFO). But I didn't really understand why we couldn't just use the built-in Array push method to manage the stack (if the stack was made using a constructor function). After today's review, it's making more sense now; if I'm using a constructor function to create an instance, that instance is an **object**, not an array. This explains why I had to create my own push method in the object's prototype so that I can appropriately access the stack (typically represented as an array) available in my object instance. Another topic I reviewed today was the difference between Arrow functions and regular functions and this article [Anomalies in JavaScript Arrow Functions](https://blog.logrocket.com/anomalies-in-javascript-arrow-functions/) was a great read. Some highlights are that [you cannot use an arrow function to create a constructor function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and that the arrow functions cannot be invoked with the `new` keyword, and that they automatically binds `this` to the surrounding code's context. For the Weather App that I finalized before, I finally found some time to refactor code to utilize object destructuring and constants for variables such as error messages and units.

## Day 54: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review functional programming, higher-order functions and methods, and callback functions

**Thoughts**: When I first started to learn programming, the terms "imperative" and "declarative" styles of programming were confusing to me. In essence, imperative programming describes HOW your program should achieve something (ex. step by step) and is used in object-oriented programming, whereas declarative programming describes WHAT your program should ultimately achieve and is used in functional programming). Now that I know about the higher-order functions and methods, they make more sense to me since higher-order functions make it a lot easier for you to just tell your program what to do (ex. triple every number in the array) rather than having to specify the steps of achieving the same goal. Callback functions were also very confusing to me at first (I mean, it's called a "callback" function - back then I was wondering what exactly you are calling back?). With practice, I am now more comfortable using them in my code and it's such an important part of JavaScript since it's used everywhere.
 
## Day 55: March 25, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review JavaScript array higher-order functions
- [x] Refactor Todo List code
- [x] React JS Introduction (The Odin Project)

**Thoughts**: Some notes to self: remember to **actually RETURN** something inside of the higher-order functions and be aware of **what's being returned**! Too many times I have assumed that my function returns a value when in reality, I see `undefined` being returned instead 😅. For the Todo List, I made some small edits to refactor code such as deleting unused imports from modules, removing unnecessary comments (the ones that don't add value to code), and adding consistency to module names (starting all with capital letters). 

## Day 56: March 26, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Update Todo List README
- [x] Continue the React JS Introduction lesson
- [x] React State and Props

**Thoughts**: I learned that it's best to update the README when the project is still fresh on your mind. It's been almost 2.5 weeks since I finalized the Todo List project, but I have not gotten around to update the README for it with demo gifs, features, and learning outcomes. It was definitely more difficult to remember everything after some time has passed. But what matters is that I updated it ☺️. Continuing from yesterday, I finished the Introduction to React and the React State and Props lessons from the Odin Project. I had built a project using React before but it was still a nice refresher on topics such as what the JSX is (JavaScript Syntax Extension that allows dynamic HTML), virtual DOM, and that components can have states (which is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves). In addition to watching YouTube videos, I followed along the React tutorial from [Scrimba Learn React Free Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) and it was great since I got to work on mini challenges on writing JSX, making my own components, and the overall usage/syntax for react. I will continue working on the tutorial tomorrow as well. 


## Day 57: March 27, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Scrimba React tutorial (props, state, event handlers)

**Thoughts**: I continued to work on the React tutorial by Scrimba and it provided good hands-on practice on getting the correct React syntax and learning about props (uni-directional data flow from parent to child), state (change state using the `setState` method), and event handlers. Throughout the lesson, I read the React documentations to supplement the tutorial and I'm glad that I have improved on reading the documentation and understanding it more thoroughly. When I first started learning JavaScript and React, documentation was difficult to understand. It's such an important skill to have since it's the source of truth not only for MDN or React documentation but also for the third party libraries and APIs.

## Day 58: March 28, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Work on the React CV Project (The Odin Project)

**Thoughts**: Since React heavily emphasizes the use of components, knowing how to break up UI into reusable components seems like one of the most important skills to have, but also is one of the most difficult to gain. It feels similar to breaking up vanilla JavaScript code into modules to be used with Webpack. Fortunately, both skills will improve with practice and experience over time. So far for the React CV Project, which allows the user to input general, education, and experience data to generate a CV/resume, I have three different components for each section. Each component has form elements for name, email, phone number, and other necessary data to create a CV. For some form elements, I can probably make them as separate reusable components so that the user can click on a button to generate multiple education sections (ex. multiple degrees, previous positions) and provide corresponding information.

## Day 59: March 29, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review JS Classes (ES5 & ES6 way of class-subclass)
- [x] Go down the rabbit hole of JavaScript 🐰

**Thoughts**: Today I went down the Rabbit hole of JavaScript advanced topics: from ES5 way of extending a subclass from baseclass to reading through the documentation and YouTube videos on how the `.call` method works, to how the context/value of `this` is determined, to the difference between the regular function and the arrow function syntax, to the lexical scope. Reflecting back on it, I think they are all related since it's difficult to understand one of these concepts without knowing the other (for example, `this`! It often drives me crazy 🤯). Going down the rabbit hole would be ineffective if I wasn't taking notes or retaining any knowledge that I read or watched, but today was pretty productive because I have a better understanding of the topics listed above. For instance, when you use the standard `function` keyword, the context of `this` depends on where the function was **invoked/called**. When you use arrow functions, the context of `this` depends on where the parent function was **defined**. Next time when I want to focus on the topics on hand, I can try time-boxing the amount of time I am allowed to spend in the rabbit hole. Often times, I do enjoy exploring different parts of JavaScript for the spaced learning opportunity and exposing myself to new concepts, so going down the rabbit hole is pretty interesting 😅

## Day 60: March 30, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Review the context of `this` in different use cases
- [x] Continue the React CV Project

**Thoughts**: I focused on how the value/context of `this` in JavaScript changes depending on how the function is invoked (call-site). For the React CV project, I need more practice with applying the concept of which component to store the states (since state belongs to a component) and passing down props (you can pass down state as props!) to the children components since they can get confusing when I work with multiple components. Hopefully after finishing this React project, I will have a better idea on how to navigate such topics.

## Day 61: March 31, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Study JavaScript "this"
- [x] Continue the React CV Project
- [x] Start watching the React Bootcamp Youtube Video series

**Thoughts**: I spent some more time studying `this` and solving some practice problems of determining `this` based on call-sites and the four `this` binding rules. Once again, I clicked on the [purple link - Mastering ‘this’ in JavaScript: Callbacks and bind(), apply(), call()](https://thenewstack.io/mastering-javascript-callbacks-bind-apply-call/) ([already introduced in Day 48 of my 100 days of code 😂](https://github.com/DevKarenC/100-days-of-code#day-48-march-18-2021)) and reminded myself that the `this` value changes when a function gets invoked inside a higher-order function. The callback function follows the `this` context for its enclosing parent function. Besides studying `this`, I wanted to set aside some time to continue the CV project and learn more React so I was able to work on passing down state as props from parent to child components so that a button click will trigger a state change and allow for conditional rendering. I came across the Youtube video series for [React Bootcamp by Tyler McGinnis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GXXGJRDMdQ) and it looks good for additional React practice, so I'll be continuing the series tomorrow.

## Day 62: April 1, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Fight the Imposter Syndrome
- [x] Used recursion to build Hangman game
- [x] Solve practice problems (mini-algorithms like Pig Latin)
- [x] Continue the React CV Project

**Thoughts**: As someone learning how to program, there are days where I experience the imposter syndrome. Here are some notes to self for what helped me handle imposter syndrome:
1. Google "programming gives me imposter syndrome" and realize I'm not the only one feeling this way: as of April 1, 2021, I have found 1,040,000 results on Google search, meaning that others have experienced it (been there, done that!). Reading an article or two helps me learn from others (even senior engineers feel that way so imagine someone trying to land her first software engineer job 🤗)
2. Help other people in the software development community: this not only makes me feel good about myself for being able to help, but also shows that I actually know something enough to help others understand. The best way to learn is to teach others, so it's good for combatting imposter syndrome and also reinforces my learning!
3. Look at my old code (and cringe for 30 seconds) and reflect on how far I have accomplished: back in the days, I didn't like working in command line interface. I used to prefer GUI but hey, now CLI is life ☺️. Also, I didn't enjoy using higher-order array functions like `.forEach`, `.map`, `.reduce`. I thought I could accomplish the same goals using for loops and for loops were "easier". But now my go-to functions are higher-order functions and I know how important they are for declarative functional programming. They became easier with practice. Now I try to reduce the number of for loops in my code.

## Day 63: April 2, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Solve mini-algorithm problems (difficult - means I'm learning!)

**Thoughts**: Whenever I solve a difficult problem and get stuck, I do the following: take a break, think about it in the shower, sleep and return to it the next day. It helps so much to take a rest or just get up and stretch instead of giving in and looking at the solution. Obviously there are time where I look at the solution; for example, if I don't know what a binary search tree is, I won't spend days and weeks trying to figure out a BST problem. Not giving up and thinking about the problem is a great way to improve critical thinking skills. It feels great when I finally solve the problem and then look at the solution to further learn from others. I didn't mention it in yesterday's post but another thing that helps me tackle imposter syndrome is to imagine how I would support my friend in the same situation. Since I know how much effort my friend (me ☺️) puts into studying programming, I would encourage her by telling her to keep up the good work. You should be your own best friend and champion.

## Day 64: April 3, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Continue to solve mini-algorithm problems

**Thoughts**: I continued to solve mini-algorithm problems from yesterday (I refer to them as mini because I'm not actually using algorithms such as binary search, sort, or dynamic programming, but I do have to think harder and put more effort into solving them than other problems 😅). I'm proud that I was able to solve the problems that I was initially stuck on. For some problems, I solved it utilizing stack data structure and nested loops. I hope to wrap them up tomorrow and look at how other people solved them!

## Day 65: April 4, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Continue the React CV Project
- [x] Solve the mini-algorithm problems and learn from others' code line by line 

**Thoughts**: One of the good ways to improve programming skills is to read other people's code. It helps because you get to know how others approached the problem and implemented it. Although helpful, it is still one of the difficult skills to have and sometimes I don't even understand what I wrote a week ago unless I left good comments for the future self 👀. For one of the problems that I struggled with, I reviewed someone else's solution line by line and wrote comments so I can refer to them later. I noticed that while writing comments to understand the code is important but it's also important to understand their overall strategy and the main goal of each line of code (for example, it might be easy to figure out that a line of code is checking whether a property already exists in the object, but you also need to know **why** they are checking for the property. For the question I was referring to, it was to check if there was a duplicate value in the object.)

## Day 66: April 5, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Finalize the React CV Project
- [x] Re-do the problem I was stuck on without looking back at notes

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I was able to solve the problem that I was struggling with yesterday, without looking back at notes or solution. It's a good practice since it enforces what I learned and tells me whether I truly understood the solution and the approach instead of merely memorizing the answer (of course there are times where memorizing helps a lot!). I was able to finalize the React CV Project and updated the README with some learning goals and the demo gif as always. From completing the project, I obtained the understanding of conditional/dynamic rendering of components, state management and props system.

## Day 67: April 6, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Free React Bootcamp Videos Day 1 and 2

**Thoughts**: From watching the [Free React.js Bootcamp videos by uidotdev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHfRLQuHjsU), I learned about how React works under the hood (for example, the `React.createElement()` method and what arguments it takes in, how React **elements** are different from React **components**. "**React Component** is a **function or class**, which optionally accepts input, and **returns a React Element**.") Also, the instructor clearly explained that `props` are to React components, what `arguments` are to functions. Along with additional practice with passing in props to components and dynamic rendering using the setState method, I am becoming more comfortable with React. I will be starting the Memory Game project tomorrow as suggested by the Odin Project as well as learn about the lifecycle methods and hooks.

## Day 68: April 7, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Watch the Free React Bootcamp Video - Day 3
- [x] Learn about React Lifecycle Methods
- [x] Start working on the React Memory Game
- [x] Learn about React Hooks

**Thoughts**: I spent some time learning about the React lifecycle methods and the sequence of how they work:
1. First the `constructor` function will be called and the initial states will be established.
2. UI will be rendered with those initial states using the `render` method.
3. Once mounted to the DOM, `componentDidMount` is called.
4. If there are any updates to the components (ex. new props/states), `componentDidUpdate` will be called.
5. If there are components being unmounted, `componentWillUnmount` will be called immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed.
The Free React bootcamp video was good for learning the basics of React but since this video was released before the React hooks were introduced, I watched a [different video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX_L39UvZes&t=7s) to learn how to use hooks inside of functional components. Funny enough, just as I learned about React lifecycle methods, hooks encourage thinking in terms of synchronization rather than lifecycle methods. Regardless, lifecycle methods are still important part of React since not all code is written using hooks and hooks such as `useEffect` still have a similar idea as lifecycle methods.

## Day 69: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Create a number guessing game using vanilla JavaScript
- [x] Learn about React Hooks
- [x] Work on the React Memory Game

**Thoughts**: The best way to learn something is by doing, so I'm using Hooks for the React Memory Game (spongebob squarepants theme 🧽). Unlike class components, there is less code to achieve the same goals for the functional components. They utilize destructuring very often as well. Overall, I enjoy how React is more clean to read and write than vanilla JavaScript, thanks to JSX. I'm excited to start building more projects using React 🥳

## Day 70: April 9, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻
- [x] Continue working on the React Memory Game

**Thoughts**: I continued to work on the React Memory Game and made good progress on the important features of the game. Before diving into writing code, I took the time to brainstorm on how to achieve a functionality (ex. clicking on a card increases a score unless a duplicate card is chosen - in which case, game over). I came up with multiple approaches and ultimately proceeded with the one that made the most sense to me. For example, I didn't feel like there was a need for individual Card component to know that they are clicked; only the App component (parent) needs to know in order to keep track of the game. Fortunately this logic worked out pretty well. Another logic that was confusing was implementing the GameOver component. I wasn't sure how to communicate the click event for the "play again" button from the GameOver component (child) to the App component (parent). I thought I needed to have a "play again" logic (i.e. reset game data) inside of GameOver since that's where the button element was. But since App is in charge of handling game data such as cardsClicked and checking for duplicates, I realized I can have the reset the game data logic inside of App. I just needed to pass down that logic via props for the onClick event handler to the button inside of GameOver component. Nothing is being "passed up" to App from GameOver - the child component is just handling the onClick event for the parent. Also learned that you can provide `onClick` and other events only on **DOM elements**, not your own custom components (this explains why I passed down the onClick logic down to GameOver component via props).
