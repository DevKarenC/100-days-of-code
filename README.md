# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!

## 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 0: Jan 29, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Finish the Etch-A-Sketch project

**Thoughts:** Before I started the project, I read the guidelines provided by the Odin Project and created a list of Minimum Viable Product features and optional features that the app would still function without, but would definitely be nice to have. This list helped me focus on what I should prioritize before diving into additional features.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] How to apply styling to certain elements using [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
- [x] How to generate random RGB color
- [x] How to add styling to native HTML color picker

**Link to work:** [Etch-A-Sketch App](https://devkarenc.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

## Day 1: Jan 30, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Work on the Odin Project - Fundamentals Part 5
- [x] Work on JavaScript30 Day 4

**Thoughts**: It was nice to refresh my memory on objects and higher-order array methods. I appreciate that there are free and accessible resources to make me better at JavaScript.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] `console.table()` function to display my data as a table!
- [x] How objects are ordered in JavaScript (integer properties are ordered in ascending order vs. non-integer properties are ordered in creation order)

**Link to work**: [JavaScript30 Repo with notes](https://github.com/DevKarenC/JavaScript30-with-notes)

## Day 2: Jan 31, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Work on the Odin Project - Fundamentals Part 5
- [x] Work on JavaScript30 Day 7
- [x] Start the Calculator project

**Thoughts**: I continued to work on the JavaScript exercises on objects and array methods available on the Odin Project and the second part to the higher order array methods offered by JavaScript30 course.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Understanding how other people solved the Caesar Cipher problem and how to improve my solution
- [x] How to use `.some()`, `.every()`, `.find()`, `.findIndex()`

## Day 3: Feb 1, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Work on the Calculator project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 1 (Drum Kit)

**Thoughts**: I wanted to try out a new CSS layout in addition to the Flexbox, and thought CSS Grid Layout was the perfect alternative for my Calculator project. It worked great for my purpose and I can't wait to start using it for my other projects! As for the logic portion of the calculator, I noticed that there were many edge cases to implement the decimal point functionality.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)

## Day 4: Feb 2, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Review notes
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 2 (CSS Clock)
- [x] Object and Object Constructors
- [x] Continue working on the Calculator

**Thoughts**: I am slowly making progress on the Calculator, although there are some corner cases that I should consider. For example, the calculator should display an output whether the user clicks on the equal (=) sign or any other operators such as +, -, /, or \*. Also the number cannot start with a 0 (or have 2 consecutive zero's), but the user should be able to perform mathematical operations with 0. I spent some time trying to figure out the logic, and decided to take a break by learning about object and object constructors. Object-oriented programming is such an important concept, and I look forward to the day when I can comfortably utilize it in my own project.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Object Constructors and relevant concepts including `new`, `prototype`, and `this`

## Day 5: Feb 3, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Object and Object Constructors
- [x] Recipe Library Project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 3 (CSS Variables)

**Thoughts**: There were so many concepts in Objects that were new to me including how the `new` keyword behind the scenes, what the `prototype` object is, and how the `this` keyword fits into the system. Since I wanted to practice the new knowledge (and I think the best way is to work on a project that incorporates them!), I got started on the Library Project. I tweaked the project a little bit, and decided to make a Recipe Library where a user can save their favorite recipes.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] How to create a modal box with CSS and JavaScript
- [x] [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

## Day 6: Feb 4, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Practice recursion problems on codewars

**Thoughts**: I had the opportunity to participate in the short mock interview session with an Engineering Mentor, and was given a recursion problem to solve. It is definitely more nervous to code with someone else under the interview setting, and I know that the only way to get better is to keep practicing until I get comfortable thinking out loud! Just like any other skills in programming, knowing how to communicate your thoughts to your interview and fellow engineers is a skill you can improve with practice.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Using default parameters in recursive functions
- [x] Thinking out loud when practicing algorithm problems (just do it)

## Day 7: Feb 5, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Finalize the Calculator Project

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the online Calculator Project inspired by the Odin Project. The calculator is able to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, x, / with both positive and negative and floating point numbers), and it is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It was a great learning opportunity as I had to refactor my code to handle edge cases and making sure that the basic functions of a calculation are performed correctly. For instance, a number cannot (1) have more than one decimal point or (2) lead with a zero (trailing zero's are fine). Also, if a number is negative, the negative sign should disappear with the first digit as the user clicks on the backspace button (i.e. a negative sign cannot hang alone). While the project was challenging, it is rewarding to see the finished product without giving up! I cannot wait to work on other projects that will advance my programming skills.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Considering edge cases and handling them with care
- [x] DOM Manipulation

## Day 8: Feb 6, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Work on the Recipe Library Project
- [x] JavaScript30-with-notes Repo

**Thoughts**: I am making a good progress on the recipe library project inspired by the Odin Project, and I hope to finalize it tomorrow! Also I have been following Wes Bos' JavaScript30 exercises and made a repo to record, share, and review what I have learned from them. Just like this 100 days of code repo, it will be updated on a regular basis.

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30 with Notes](https://github.com/DevKarenC/JavaScript30-with-notes)

## Day 9: Feb 7, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Finalize the Recipe Library Project and update Readme

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the Recipe Library project and also update the Readme (which feels like another project on its own) with a short description, list of features, and project demos. Although I first learned about data attributes from JavaScript30 Day 1 exercise, I haven't gotten a chance to put my knowledge in practice until this project. It's a very useful and cool feature to use, and I can see myself using it for my future projects as well.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Using a third-party library ([Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/))
- [x] Putting data-attributes in practice

**Link to work:** [Recipe Library](https://github.com/DevKarenC/recipe-library)

## Day 10: Feb 8, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Learn about Factory Functions (The Odin Project lesson)

**Thoughts**: I spent some time to learn about the factory functions in JavaScript. With factory functions, we can simply set up and return a new object. To deepen my understanding, I also learned about how execution contexts, scope, and closure are all related and are very important concepts in JavaScript. Seeing how factory functions can make our code easier to read, refactor, and test inspired me to organize my code using factory functions and write more modular code.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] Factory functions
- [x] Execution Context (global and function)
- [x] Scope
- [x] Closure

## Day 11: Feb 9, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Learn about the JS Module Pattern
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 5 (Flex Panels Image Gallery)
- [x] Start the Tic-tac-toe Project using modules

**Thoughts**: Learning about the JavaScript module pattern was great, since they are a practical way to make my code organized, reusable, and isolated. The best way to practice something new is to actually use it, so I started working on the Tic-tac-toe project where I thought about how to break down different pieces before I started writing code. Since I am putting more thought into how I structure my code, it is taking me longer to craft each line of code. It's all part of the learning process! On another note, the Odin Project (TOP) is great, and I think one way to fully utilize it is to make sure that I am learning from other resources. After realizing that some articles and videos suggested by TOP are from 2015 (which is the year when ES6 came out, but I'm sure it took people some time to adapt), I looked for resources that incorporated ES6 and more modern JavaScript and learned from those as well. Wes Bos' JavaScript30 is great as always, and spending ~30 minutes to independently try and achieve the desired outcomes help me learn better rather than just watching the video and copying his code (unless I am totally lost - then I learn from the expert 😅)

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] JS Module Pattern
- [x] How to organize HTML/CSS code
- [x] flex property for the flexbox, translateY property, cubic-bezier... all the cool CSS knowledge!
- [x] JS classList.toggle() method instead of using if-else
- [x] listening to the transitionend event

## Day 12: Feb 10, 2021

**Today's Progress** 😎

- [x] Continue working on the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 8 (HTML5 Canvas)

**Thoughts**: I continued working on the tic-tac-toe project and making some progress on how to write factory functions. I still need more practice on determining which variables and methods to keep private or public, but it's fun to think about how they would impact the overall picture. Sometimes I find myself thinking too hard about the structure and not writing enough code, and I tell myself that I can always start getting some features done first and refactor my code later since I don't want to get bogged down with the fact that I should be writing the _perfect_ code from the get-go. We all have to start somewhere.

**What I Learned 💡**

- [x] HTML5 Canvas, 2D context and different properties and methods associated with the context

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30 with Notes - Day 8](https://github.com/DevKarenC/JavaScript30-with-notes/blob/main/08%20-%20Fun%20with%20HTML5%20Canvas/index-START.html)

## Day 13: Feb 11, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue working on the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] Review factory functions & function declarations and expressions
- [x] Learn how to use Chrome/Firefox/VS debuggers
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 9 (Cool Dev Tools Tricks)

**Thoughts**: For the tic-tac-toe project, I was able to add JavaScript logic to display O or X symbol depending on which player's turn it is and determine the winner. One issue I encountered was that the gameboard in the DOM was showing a different symbol from what was in the actual gameboard array. Learning how to use a debugger was really a game changer since I did not use a single line of `console.log()` to fix the issue! All I had to do was add several break points and add variables in the Watch tab of VS Code. I hope to finalize the project within the next 2 days.

## Day 14: Feb 12, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue working on the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 10 (Checkbox Challenge)

**Thoughts**: Majority of today was spent working on the tic-tac-toe project and the JavaScript30's Checkbox challenge. Although I have yet to learn the TDD (Test Driven Development), I think it would have been beneficial for the tic-tac-toe project because as I was testing my code, I found myself clicking on the board 100+ times to see if there are any holes in the logic. Perhaps when I work on the Connect Four project in the future, I can implement the TDD. As for the checkbox challenge, I am glad that I was able to write the code independently first before diving into the lesson. The tough part was performing the necessary actions _while_ listening to the shift keydown event simultaneously. After researching, I learned that you can do so by declaring a boolean variable that will toggle its boolean value as it listens to both the `keydown` and `keyup` event. I still watched how Wes Bos tackled the challenge, and it was a good learning experience.

## Day 15: Feb 13, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Finalize the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 11 (Custom HTML Video Player)

**Thoughts**: There are just so many things I learned while working on the tic-tac-toe project (which will be discussed in the project Readme) but the big ones are utilizing comments to improve code readability and managing the scope creep. I found it helpful to leave comments in code to myself (and future fellow engineers 😎) to demonstrate the rationale on why I wrote certain functions. I am aware that there are different opinions on whether comments improve code readability or not, and I can see where both sides are coming from. For now, I like to leave comments on my work since there is still much for me to learn, and one way I learn is by documenting the work. As for managing the scope creep, I found myself coming up with new features that wasn't included in my original list of features. While they were good features to have for the user experience, it was also important for me to finish the project and distribute the resources (time and energy) on other programming topics. 

**Link to work:** [Tic-tac-toe Project](https://github.com/DevKarenC/tic-tac-toe)

## Day 16: Feb 14, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Refactor the code base for the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] Review Prototypes, prototype chain, this keyword
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 12 (Key Sequence Detection)

**Thoughts**: I was able to get feedback on how to improve my code for the tic-tac-toe project from a senior engineer. Some of the new things I learned is that it can be beneficial to create constants for values such as empty string, O symbol string, and X symbol string since that would help me manage the values with one source of truth. If I were to change the symbols to some other values such as a space or a diamond, I can simply change the value for the constants. The naming convention for constants is using all uppercase characters. In addition, I was able to remove unnecessary variables that don't add value to the code. For instance, the `haveWinner` boolean variable inside the `determineWinner()` function was unnecessary since I could have simply returned `true` or `false`. 

## Day 17: Feb 15, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Update the Readme for the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 13 (Slide in on Scroll)
- [x] ES6 Classes (The Odin Project)

**Thoughts**: I can say that the tic-tac-toe project is "officially" done now that I updated the Readme for it! It's a good way to showcase what I have done and also acts as a personal reminder for my accomplishments. I am also almost halfway done with the Wes Bos' JavaScript30 courses, and I appreciate learning something new everyday. The Slide in on Scroll lesson was focused on understanding the different heights (innerHeight, offsetTop...) related to the window or the HTML element and involved more math than other topics. The debouncing and throttling are also something I can see myself using in the future. This [site](http://demo.nimius.net/debounce_throttle/) helped me understand the difference between the two. 

## Day 18: Feb 16, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Refactor the Recipe Library project using ES6 Classes
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 14 (References vs. Copy)
- [x] The History of JavaScript - ES6 Modules (The Odin Project)

**Thoughts**: I refactored the code for the Recipe Library to use ES6 classes feature instead of using plain constructors. I feel more confident in using classes in my future projects and look forward to using the `extends` keyword as well to practice inheritance. Today's JavaScript30 lesson on pass by reference vs. pass by copy refreshed my memory on those topics. The lesson was released in 2017, so it was interesting to learn that some features mentioned as "not official" in JS actually became an official feature in JS - such as using a spread operator with an object literal to make a shallow copy of it. Also learning of the [tc39 repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) where one can see the different features being proposed to be official is very cool. I will continue to learn from the ES6 Modules lesson in the Odin Project.


## Day 19: Feb 17, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Continue learning about the History of JavaScript, npm, yarn, webpack, and ES6 Modules (The Odin Project)
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 15 (localStorage and Event Delegation)

**Thoughts**: Learning about the History of Javascript was interesting and now I have a better understanding of how ES6 modules came about and why they are beneficial. JavaScript has come a long way from plain HTML and JS to using a package manager, a module bundler, a transpiler and a task runner to automate various features. I have heard about webpack before and how it's a "module bundler", but did not really know what that meant. After watching videos about it and coding along the tutorial in the documentation, it's making more sense. As for JavaScript30, it was a good lesson to learn about localStorage and event delegation. I can see myself using those feature in the future for my projects.

## Day 20: Feb 18, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] Learn about the Object-oriented Programming Principles (The Odin Project)
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 15 Bonus Challenges 
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 25 (Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling, and Once)
- [x] Start the Pet Photography Website project

**Thoughts**: I completed the challenge suggested by Wes Bos for JS30 Day 15, which was to add 3 different buttons (delete item, check all checkboxes, uncheck all checkboxes). What helped me with the challenges were being able to analyze the code from the lesson, tweak them to match my need, and to take a step back to rethink about the initial approach and come up with a better one. There was a lot to learn from Wes Bos' code and I like how he made a separate `populateList` function to handle the DOM manipulation. For today's JS30 lesson, I skipped to Day 25 because the topics (Event capture, propagation, bubbling...) seemed relevant to Event Delegation, which is what I learned yesterday. Without a doubt, I read multiple articles that discussed how bubbling allows event delegation to happen. The more I study JavaScript, the more topics I come across that I did not know existed. The "SOLID" OOP Principles and Pub-Sub Design Pattern are good examples of such topics. For my project (the Odin Project suggested making a Restaurant Page, but I decided to go with something different and will create a pet photography website instead 🐕🐈), I look forward to applying the Single Responsibility principle to improve my code.

## Day 21: Feb 19, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 16 CSS Text Shadow
- [x] Learn about CSS positions and units
- [x] Work on the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: I finished another day of JavaScript30 and as always, learning about one topic led me to research other relevant topics. In today's lesson, Wes Bos used the offsetX and offsetY properties but I was curious about other properties included in the event object, such as clientX, pageX, and screenX. It feels good to supplement the knowledge with the documentation, helpful YouTube videos and Stack Overflow posts. The Pet Photography website project is coming along pretty well - using modules to divide up the code makes it easier to follow and more clean to read.

## Day 22: Feb 20, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 17 Sort without Articles
- [x] Learn about regular expressions
- [x] Continue working on the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: Today's JavaScript30 lesson was short, but regardless it refreshed my mind on how to use the `sort()` method and how knowing regular expressions (commonly known as regex) can be useful. From the Coding Train's YouTube channel, I learned how regex breaks down a word to spot a generalized pattern (for example: the word "Rainbow" can be broken down into a capital R, followed by a lowercase a, lowercase i... all the way until a lowercase w.) There is a whole video series on regex and I look forward to engaging with the rest in the future. I'm continuing to work on the Pet Photography website project and simultaneously taking notes on what I would like to improve on or refactor. The tab switching works fine but there is always room to grow. Let's see how I can refactor once I'm done with the project.

## Day 23: Feb 21, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 18 (Tally String Times with Reduce)
- [x] Continue working on the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: Learning how to add the total durations of videos using the array reduce method was a good way to build on the foundations of JavaScript. Before diving into Wes Bos' solution, I solved the problem on my own using different methods such as .forEach(), .map(), .split(), and more. It felt great when I learned that I wrote a similar line of code as a pro but also created something different independently. Out of the three tabs in my project scope, I finished two tabs so I only have one more to go. I hope to finalize the pet photography website project tomorrow and look forward to receiving feedback to improve my code. 

## Day 24: Feb 22, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 19 (Webcam Fun)
- [x] Learn about promises, async/await
- [x] Finish the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: JavaScript has changed so much in the last 3 years ever since the JavaScript 30 series came out. Some of the features introduced in today's lesosn such as `Navigator.getUserMedia` and `localMediaStream` were deprecated and no longer recommended by the MDN. It was confusing at first because `Navigator.getUserMedia` was deprecated so MDN recommended `MediaDevices.getUserMedia`, but I ended up using `Navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` since `Navigator.mediaDevices` returns the `MediaDevices` object. Also looking through the MDN examples to see how the method is used helped a lot. In regards to setting up the project, Wes Bos introduces browser-sync but I think I could have used the Live Server VSCode extension to achieve the same outcome. I did learn that using `npm install` without any arguments installs dependencies outlined in `package.json`, which is pretty cool. Although I haven't played much with media streams such as webcam and canvas before, it was still a good lesson that extended to other important topics such as promise, .then(), .catch(). As for the Pet Photography website, I was able to finish writing code for the essential modules. I will take some time tomorrow to refactor, update Readme, and deploy the project github page since the project was built using webpack.

## Day 25: Feb 23, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 20 (Speech Recognition)
- [x] Learn about Webpack asset management
- [x] Refactor code, update readme, and deploy the Pet Photography Website Project

**Thoughts**: I loved today's JS30 topic of Speech recognition since I always thought it would be cool to work with it! I primarily use Firefox for deveopment so when I first tried the feature in a Firefox browser, unfortunately it did not work due to the feature not being supported (in fact, multitude of other browsers did not support the Speech Recognition Web API according to the browser compatibility table in MDN docs). At the end of the lesson, I enjoyed thinking about the practical examples like "Siri/Alexa -  get the weather" as suggested by Wes Bos and I can't wait to build an application that uses speech recognition. One idea that comes to mind is a [Smart Home with Raspberry Pi](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/02/how-to-build-your-own-private-smart-home-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-mozillas-things-gateway/). As for the Pet Photography website, I refactored the code base to include a file for the constants such as phone number, email, address, and business hours so that it's easier to access or change them in the future. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to practice implementing the Single Responsibility principle and using webpack for module bundling. 

## Day 26: Feb 24, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 21 (Geolocation-based Speedometer and Compass)
- [x] Learn about Webpack output management and development
- [x] Learn about JSON
- [x] Review callbacks and learn about promises

**Thoughts**: I had a chance to briefly try out the iPhone simulator on xcode and it was great. It's a feature that I didn't know even existed. I can see that it will be useful when I learn how to use the React Native framework and test my application on the xcode simulator. Continuing with the Odin Project curriculum, I learned more about webpack plugins related to output management (ex. HTMLWebpackPlugin) and also Development. Source map is great since it tells you which file and line the error came from instead of just printing that the error came from `bundle.js`. I have previously used webpack's --watch mode to automatically compile my code, and I will try out the `webpack-dev-server` in the future.

## Day 27: Feb 25, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 22 (Follow along and highlight links)
- [x] Design wireframes for the Todo List Project
- [x] Set up the Todo List Project with webpack
- [x] Learn about Linting

**Thoughts**: As I go through the JavaScript30 lessons, not only do I learn from the lessons but also from other people's YouTube video comments. Today's lesson was related to hovering over the links and making the white highlight span appear on the hovered links. One of the comments wrote that this feature would be useful for the tooltip system, which would be cool to have in my future projects. For my next project, I plan to work on the Todo list as suggested by The Odin Project, and I designed some wireframes and set up the configuration files for eslint and webpack. I have been using eslint extension for VSCode, but not as a dev-dependency. It's awesome that I will be learning from a different style guide (I chose Airbnb), but I also acknowledge that it's important to stay flexible and open-minded since every team would follow a different style guide.


## Day 28: Feb 26, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 26 (Stripe Follow Along Navigation)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project
- [x] Learn about different CSS frameworks

**Thoughts**: I skipped to Day 26 of JavaScript30 to continue with where I left off in yesterday's lesson of following along the navigation links. I reviewed the "this" keyword and the arrow function scope as they were discussed during the lesson, and also learned that you can use `display: none` and `opacity: 0` in two different classes and toggle those properties to create the smooth transition effect. As I continued to work on the Todo List project, I decided to explore [different options for CSS libraries and frameworks](https://geekflare.com/best-css-frameworks/) and came across Bulma. I like the fact that its classes are very readable and it offers helpful documentation and video courses, so I will be using it throughout the project. Excited to use and learn something new!

## Day 29: Feb 27, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 6 (fetch type ahead)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: I went back to Day 6 of JavaScript30 since I wanted to learn about Fetch API, but I learned more regex than fetch in my opinion. Regex can be useful in many situations so I'm glad I got additional practice. For the Todo list project, I created two classes - one for TodoList and the other for TodoItem. I did not make one extend from another class, since I thought those two classes were pretty distinctive and did not require inheritance. Perhaps in the future I can refactor code, but that's the idea for now. In addition, I reviewed my project features to see how the user would add a todo item and noticed that the user can only add a todo item inside a todo list (i.e. folder of todo items). Therefore, I only exported the TodoList class with addTodo method, which creates a new instance of a TodoItem class. It takes me some time to plan it out, but it's fun thinking in terms of object oriented programming 👏🏻 

## Day 30: Feb 28, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 23 (Speech Synthesis)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: There is always a lot to learn in the JavaScript30 lessons, and I have a longer list of what I learned today. For example, it's a good idea to look through the YouTube comments to see if anyone else had the similar problem as me, or offered a solution. The project did not work for me in Firefox and I thought the feature wasn't supported in the Firefox browser. But the browser support table suggested otherwise, and I learned from a comment that I can call `.getVoices()` method on `window.speechSynthesis` and then call the `populateVoices()` method on page load. After following another programmer's advice, it worked on both Chrome and Firefox like magic! In addition, it's great to learn from how Wes Bos structures his code; he divides functionalities into multiple functions instead of putting everything into one big function. Also, I like how we can first test if the callback function is working properly by including a simple `console.log()` inside the function definition to see if we see the text in the console. As for the Todo List, I am slowly making progress by adding functionality to the "+ New List" button. 

## Day 31: Mar 1, 2021

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 24 (Sticky Nav)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: From today's JavaScript 30 lesson, I was able to fill in some gaps in my CSS knowledge. For instance, I did not realize that you can add a class to the overarching parent div (such as body) and use CSS combinators to conditionally refer to the descendant elements for the before and after CSS effects. Also, I learned the difference between the `width` and `max-width` properties in terms of resizing the screen, since the element can be responsive when used with `max-width`. For the Todo List project, I worked on getting the static version of the todo list done so that I have the visuals to refer to when converting it to the dynamic page. It's helpful when I can easily see how the page would look and to which elements I should add the event listeners.

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 27 (Click and Drag)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: I came across the [MDN Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer) that offers a vast variety of articles and active learning practices to complete for different topics in web development. I had previously read some articles as they were suggested by the Odin Project, but didn't know MDN also offered such a roadmap for beginners striving to become a front-end web developer. I primarily used MDN for documentation purposes to confirm my knowledge regarding the built-in functions, but seeing that there are many interesting topics such as cross-browser testing and Accessibility guides, I can see myself visiting MDN more often for these resources.

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 28 (Video Speed Controller)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: I made a good progress on the Todo List project today, and I think part of the reason is that I tried not to get overwhelmed by the number of functionalities I need to add. It helped to break them down into smaller pieces and tackle them one at a time. For instance, I had to convert the static todo list page to render dynamically in response to the user's click events. I tried to break it down by thinking about "What should happen when the user first clicks on the todo list on the side nav bar? What should appear first? How would the data behind the scenes change?", then made small but frequent commits to the repository. I hope to finalize the project by the end of this week and leave time to refactor and improve the code base.

**Today's Progress** 👩🏻‍💻

- [x] JavaScript30 Day 29 (Countdown Timer)
- [x] Continue the Todo List Project

**Thoughts**: After working on the timer as part of JavaScript30 exercise, I feel inspired to build my own version of the Timer as a Firefox or Chrome browser extension and publish it. Perhaps the timer could be my next project after I complete the Todo List. It would be cool and useful to create a timer that reminds the user to look away 20 feet for 20 seconds every 20 minutes, or get up and stretch for 5 minutes every hour (I spend a long time staring at the screen, so I know I'll use it for sure!). I found a helpful article by MDN related to [building your first extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension), so I'll take a look at it before I start the extension.
