# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!

## 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 0: Jan 29, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Finish the Etch-A-Sketch project

**Thoughts:** Before I started the project, I read the guidelines provided by the Odin Project and created a list of Minimum Viable Product features and optional features that the app would still function without, but would definitely be nice to have. This list helped me focus on what I should prioritize before diving into additional features.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] How to apply styling to certain elements using [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
- [x] How to generate random RGB color
- [x] How to add styling to native HTML color picker

## Day 1: Jan 30, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Work on the Odin Project - Fundamentals Part 5
- [x] Work on JavaScript30 Day 4

**Thoughts**: It was nice to refresh my memory on objects and higher-order array methods. I appreciate that there are free and accessible resources to make me better at JavaScript.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] `console.table()` function to display my data as a table!
- [x] How objects are ordered in JavaScript (integer properties are ordered in ascending order vs. non-integer properties are ordered in creation order)

## Day 2: Jan 31, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Work on the Odin Project - Fundamentals Part 5
- [x] Work on JavaScript30 Day 7
- [x] Start the Calculator project

**Thoughts**: I continued to work on the JavaScript exercises on objects and array methods available on the Odin Project and the second part to the higher order array methods offered by JavaScript30 course.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Understanding how other people solved the Caesar Cipher problem and how to improve my solution
- [x] How to use `.some()`, `.every()`, `.find()`, `.findIndex()`

## Day 3: Feb 1, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Work on the Calculator project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 1 (Drum Kit)

**Thoughts**: I wanted to try out a new CSS layout in addition to the Flexbox, and thought CSS Grid Layout was the perfect alternative for my Calculator project. It worked great for my purpose and I can't wait to start using it for my other projects! As for the logic portion of the calculator, I noticed that there were many edge cases to implement the decimal point functionality.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)

## Day 4: Feb 2, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Review notes
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 2 (CSS Clock)
- [x] Object and Object Constructors
- [x] Continue working on the Calculator

**Thoughts**: I am slowly making progress on the Calculator, although there are some corner cases that I should consider. For example, the calculator should display an output whether the user clicks on the equal (=) sign or any other operators such as +, -, /, or \*. Also the number cannot start with a 0 (or have 2 consecutive zero's), but the user should be able to perform mathematical operations with 0. I spent some time trying to figure out the logic, and decided to take a break by learning about object and object constructors. Object-oriented programming is such an important concept, and I look forward to the day when I can comfortably utilize it in my own project.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Object Constructors and relevant concepts including `new`, `prototype`, and `this`

## Day 5: Feb 3, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Object and Object Constructors
- [x] Recipe Library Project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 3 (CSS Variables)

**Thoughts**: There were so many concepts in Objects that were new to me including how the `new` keyword behind the scenes, what the `prototype` object is, and how the `this` keyword fits into the system. Since I wanted to practice the new knowledge (and I think the best way is to work on a project that incorporates them!), I got started on the Library Project. I tweaked the project a little bit, and decided to make a Recipe Library where a user can save their favorite recipes.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] How to create a modal box with CSS and JavaScript
- [x] [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

## Day 6: Feb 4, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Practice recursion problems on codewars

**Thoughts**: I had the opportunity to participate in the short mock interview session with an Engineering Mentor, and was given a recursion problem to solve. It is definitely more nervous to code with someone else under the interview setting, and I know that the only way to get better is to keep practicing until I get comfortable thinking out loud! Just like any other skills in programming, knowing how to communicate your thoughts to your interview and fellow engineers is a skill you can improve with practice.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Using default parameters in recursive functions
- [x] Thinking out loud when practicing algorithm problems (just do it)

## Day 7: Feb 5, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Finalize the Calculator Project

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the online Calculator Project inspired by the Odin Project. The calculator is able to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, x, / with both positive and negative and floating point numbers), and it is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It was a great learning opportunity as I had to refactor my code to handle edge cases and making sure that the basic functions of a calculation are performed correctly. For instance, a number cannot (1) have more than one decimal point or (2) lead with a zero (trailing zero's are fine). Also, if a number is negative, the negative sign should disappear with the first digit as the user clicks on the backspace button (i.e. a negative sign cannot hang alone). While the project was challenging, it is rewarding to see the finished product without giving up! I cannot wait to work on other projects that will advance my programming skills.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Considering edge cases and handling them with care
- [x] DOM Manipulation

## Day 8: Feb 6, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Work on the Recipe Library Project
- [x] JavaScript30-with-notes Repo

**Thoughts**: I am making a good progress on the recipe library project inspired by the Odin Project, and I hope to finalize it tomorrow! Also I have been following Wes Bos' JavaScript30 exercises and made a repo to record, share, and review what I have learned from them. Just like this 100 days of code repo, it will be updated on a regular basis.

## Day 9: Feb 7, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Finalize the Recipe Library Project and update Readme

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the Recipe Library project and also update the Readme (which feels like another project on its own) with a short description, list of features, and project demos. Although I first learned about data attributes from JavaScript30 Day 1 exercise, I haven't gotten a chance to put my knowledge in practice until this project. It's a very useful and cool feature to use, and I can see myself using it for my future projects as well.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Using a third-party library ([Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/))
- [x] Putting data-attributes in practice

**Link to work:** [Recipe Library](https://github.com/DevKarenC/recipe-library)

## Day 10: Feb 8, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Learn about Factory Functions (The Odin Project lesson)

**Thoughts**: I spent some time to learn about the factory functions in JavaScript. With factory functions, we can simply set up and return a new object. To deepen my understanding, I also learned about how execution contexts, scope, and closure are all related and are very important concepts in JavaScript. Seeing how factory functions can make our code easier to read, refactor, and test inspired me to organize my code using factory functions and write more modular code.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Factory functions
- [x] Execution Context (global and function)
- [x] Scope
- [x] Closure

## Day 11: Feb 9, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Learn about ES6 Modules
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 5 (Flex Panels Image Gallery)
- [x] Start the Tic-tac-toe Project using modules

**Thoughts**: Learning about ES6 modules was great, since they are a practical way to make my code organized, reusable, and isolated. The best way to practice something new is to actually use it, so I started working on the Tic-tac-toe project where I thought about how to break down different pieces before I started writing code. Since I am putting more thought into how I structure my code, it is taking me longer to craft each line of code. It's all part of the learning process! On another note, the Odin Project (TOP) is great, and I think one way to fully utilize it is to make sure that I am learning from newer resources. After realizing that some articles and videos suggested by TOP are from 2015 (which is the year when ES6 came out, but I'm sure it took people some time to adapt), I looked for resources that incorporated ES6 and more modern JavaScript and learned from those instead. Wes Bos' JavaScript30 is great as always, and spending ~30 minutes to independently try and achieve the desired outcomes help me learn better rather than just watching the video and copying his code (unless I am totally lost - then I learn from the expert ðŸ˜…)

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] ES6 Modules
- [x] How to organize HTML/CSS code
- [x] flex property for the flexbox, translateY property, cubic-bezier... all the cool CSS knowledge!
- [x] JS classList.toggle() method instead of using if-else
- [x] listening to the transitionend event

## Day 12: Feb 10, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Continue working on the Tic-tac-toe project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 8 (HTML5 Canvas)

**Thoughts**: I continued working on the tic-tac-toe project and making some progress on how to write factory functions. I still need more practice on determining which variables and methods to keep private or public, but it's fun to think about how they would impact the overall picture. Sometimes I find myself thinking too hard about the structure and not writing enough code, and I tell myself that I can always start getting some features done first and refactor my code later since I don't want to get bogged down with the fact that I should be writing the *perfect* code from the get-go. We all have to start somewhere.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] HTML5 Canvas, 2D context and different properties and methods associated with the context
