# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge!

## 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 0: Jan 29, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Finish the Etch-A-Sketch project

**Thoughts:** Before I started the project, I read the guidelines provided by the Odin Project and created a list of Minimum Viable Product features and optional features that the app would still function without, but would definitely be nice to have. This list helped me focus on what I should prioritize before diving into additional features.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] How to apply styling to certain elements using [CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
- [x] How to generate random RGB color
- [x] How to add styling to native HTML color picker

## Day 1: Jan 30, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Work on the Odin Project - Fundamentals Part 5
- [x] Work on JavaScript30 Day 4

**Thoughts**: It was nice to refresh my memory on objects and higher-order array methods. I appreciate that there are free and accessible resources to make me better at JavaScript.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] `console.table()` function to display my data as a table!
- [x] How objects are ordered in JavaScript (integer properties are ordered in ascending order vs. non-integer properties are ordered in creation order)

## Day 2: Jan 31, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Work on the Odin Project - Fundamentals Part 5
- [x] Work on JavaScript30 Day 7
- [x] Start the Calculator project

**Thoughts**: I continued to work on the JavaScript exercises on objects and array methods available on the Odin Project and the second part to the higher order array methods offered by JavaScript30 course.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Understanding how other people solved the Caesar Cipher problem and how to improve my solution
- [x] How to use `.some()`, `.every()`, `.find()`, `.findIndex()`

## Day 3: Feb 1, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Work on the Calculator project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 1 (Drum Kit)

**Thoughts**: I wanted to try out a new CSS layout in addition to the Flexbox, and thought CSS Grid Layout was the perfect alternative for my Calculator project. It worked great for my purpose and I can't wait to start using it for my other projects! As for the logic portion of the calculator, I noticed that there were many edge cases to implement the decimal point functionality.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)

## Day 4: Feb 2, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Review notes
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 2 (CSS Clock)
- [x] Object and Object Constructors
- [x] Continue working on the Calculator

**Thoughts**: I am slowly making progress on the Calculator, although there are some corner cases that I should consider. For example, the calculator should display an output whether the user clicks on the equal (=) sign or any other operators such as +, -, /, or \*. Also the number cannot start with a 0 (or have 2 consecutive zero's), but the user should be able to perform mathematical operations with 0. I spent some time trying to figure out the logic, and decided to take a break by learning about object and object constructors. Object-oriented programming is such an important concept, and I look forward to the day when I can comfortably utilize it in my own project.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Object Constructors and relevant concepts including `new`, `prototype`, and `this`

## Day 5: Feb 3, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Object and Object Constructors
- [x] Recipe Library Project
- [x] JavaScript30 Day 3 (CSS Variables)

**Thoughts**: There were so many concepts in Objects that were new to me including how the `new` keyword behind the scenes, what the `prototype` object is, and how the `this` keyword fits into the system. Since I wanted to practice the new knowledge (and I think the best way is to work on a project that incorporates them!), I got started on the Library Project. I tweaked the project a little bit, and decided to make a Recipe Library where a user can save their favorite recipes.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] How to create a modal box with CSS and JavaScript
- [x] [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)

## Day 6: Feb 4, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Review notes
- [x] Practice recursion problems on codewars

**Thoughts**: I had the opportunity to participate in the short mock interview session with an Engineering Mentor, and was given a recursion problem to solve. It is definitely more nervous to code with someone else under the interview setting, and I know that the only way to get better is to keep practicing until I get comfortable thinking out loud! Just like any other skills in programming, knowing how to communicate your thoughts to your interview and fellow engineers is a skill you can improve with practice.

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Using default parameters in recursive functions
- [x] Thinking out loud when practicing algorithm problems (just do it)

## Day 7: Feb 5, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Finalize the Calculator Project

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish the online Calculator Project inspired by the Odin Project. The calculator is able to perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, x, / with both positive and negative and floating point numbers), and it is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It was a great learning opportunity as I had to refactor my code to handle edge cases and making sure that the basic functions of a calculation are performed correctly. For instance, a number cannot (1) have more than one decimal point or (2) lead with a zero (trailing zero's are fine). Also, if a number is negative, the negative sign should disappear with the first digit as the user clicks on the backspace button (i.e. a negative sign cannot hang alone). While the project was challenging, it is rewarding to see the finished product without giving up! I cannot wait to work on other projects that will advance my programming skills. 

**What I Learned ðŸ’¡**

- [x] Considering edge cases and handling them with care
- [x] DOM Manipulation

## Day 8: Feb 6, 2021

**Today's Progress** ðŸ˜Ž

- [x] Work on the Recipe Library Project
- [x] JavaScript30-with-notes Repo

**Thoughts**: I am making a good progress on the recipe library project inspired by the Odin Project, and I hope to finalize it tomorrow! Also I have been following Wes Bos' JavaScript30 exercises and made a repo to record, share, and review what I have learned from them. Just like this 100 days of code repo, it will be updated on a daily basis.
